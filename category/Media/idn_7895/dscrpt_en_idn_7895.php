The research results of Raman spectra of active dielectrics (Bi12Si(Ge)O20 and NaBi(MoO4)2) in nanostructure state are submitted. The enhancement of Raman spectra intensity, appearance of new lines, intensity redistribution of lines and other features inherent to the nanocrystal state of materials in a comparison with the spectra of monocrystals were revealed. In an interpretation of specified changes the contribution of surface modes at the nanocluster-globule interface, phonon confinement effects, as well as probable changes of Bi – O bound length were taken into account.
